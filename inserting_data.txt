<The insert statement>

* Permits you to insert one or more rows into a table. 
• First, specify the table name and a list of comma-separated columns inside parentheses after the INSERT INTO clause.
• Then put a comma-separated list of values of the corresponding columns inside the parentheses following the VALUES keyword.
• The number of columns and values must be the same. In addition, the positions of columns must correspond with the positions of their values.



<nulls>
* Basic premise of an RDBMS is the concept of optional columns 
* NULL means ’not applicable’ or ’unknown’, different from zero or blank 
* If NULL is in the database, it means that there is no value for that field in the database Null equal to nothing, not even itself 
* 5 + null = null
* null = null is FALSE
* If a column was created with a NOT NULL clause, you must put in a value when doing a SELECT; otherwise, an error message will appear




<importing a CSV>
• Verify: 
  – CSV file has data that matches with the number of columns of the table and the type of data in each column.
• Create a table in MySQL with the table name that corresponds to the CSV file you want to import.
• Import through commands in either of these ways:
  – Make sure that the first row of the CSV file is ignored by typing \n as they contain the column headings, which are not considered identifiers.
  – Create a new version of the CSV file without the header column titles. Then replace the empty strings with \n which indicates NULL. Then move CSV file into a directory that MySQL can open.
