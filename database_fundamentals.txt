differenc between database, flat file, spreadsheet

database: more flexible, data consistency, more secure, support DML and DDL, less data redundancy, queries
flat file: less flexible, no data consistency, less secure, no DML and DDL, more data redundancy
spreadsheet: similar to excel, hence graphing and charting 



SQL vs NoSQL
SQL:
Structured Query Language Very rigid schema
Run transactional and/or analytical queries
Used primarily in relational databases
Easily update, delete, or add to existing databases
Uses vertical scaling, meaning changing the resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) inside of the computer or VM to fit the needs of the database

NoSQL: Non-relational or distributed database system
dynamic schema
for hierarchical data storage
not so good for complex queries 
Horizontally scalable



Database management system (DBMS): software that provides database functionality
* Define the database structure
* Enter, modify, and delete data
* Retrieve data
* Restrict access to data 



Strategies for Operating in Cloud Environments
* Sharding:
Especially important when running MySQL in a cloud
environment, as it partitions the database into smaller, more manageable parts (shards)
* Caching:
Saves on loading time by ensuring that data stored on your machine from a website or app is readily available the next time you access it
* NosQL:
Uses different types of data models, e.g. graph, document, and key-value for large data stores in cloud and web applications
